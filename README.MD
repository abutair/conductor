# Conductor

*Orchestrating language models with intuitive reinforcement learning*

## Overview

Conductor is a framework for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) designed to make LLM alignment more accessible, transparent, and efficient. It simplifies the process of training language models to align with human preferences through an intuitive reward system design and powerful visualization tools.

## Key Features

###  Simplified Reward Function Development
- Visual interface for designing and testing reward functions
- Library of composable reward primitives
- Natural language definition of rewards for non-technical users

###  Explainable Reinforcement Learning
- Visualize reward influence on model behavior
- Track response evolution across training iterations
- Reward impact attribution

###  Adaptive Reward Weighting
- Automatically adjust reward weights based on learning progress
- Detect and mitigate reward hacking
- Optimal balancing of competing rewards

###  Resource Efficiency
- Optimized for smaller GPU footprints
- Tiered implementation options for different hardware capabilities
- CPU-only training support for accessibility

## How It Works

Conductor follows a streamlined RLHF process:

1. **Load a pre-trained model** - Start with any Hugging Face compatible language model
2. **Define reward functions** - Use our visual editor or code-based approach
3. **Generate completions** - Create multiple candidate responses for each prompt
4. **Evaluate and learn** - Calculate rewards and update the model accordingly

## Getting Started

```python
from conductor import ConductorTrainer, RewardManager

# Load your model
model, tokenizer = load_pretrained_model("your-model")

# Define reward functions
rewards = RewardManager([
    AccuracyReward(weight=0.6),
    FormatReward(weight=0.2),
    LengthReward(min_length=100, max_length=500, weight=0.2)
])

# Initialize trainer
trainer = ConductorTrainer(
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    reward_manager=rewards,
    generation_config={
        "num_generations": 4,
        "max_length": 512
    }
)

# Train model
trainer.train(
    dataset=your_dataset,
    batch_size=8,
    epochs=3
)
```
